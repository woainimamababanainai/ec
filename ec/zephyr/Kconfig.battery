config PLATFORM_EC_BATTERY
	bool "Support batteries"
	help
	  Enables battery support on the board. Requires selection of a battery
	  and a charger IC.

	  If using I2C batteries, you must define I2C_PORT_BATTERY in your
	  board's i2c_map.h file so that the EC code will know which I2C
	  port the battery is on.

if PLATFORM_EC_BATTERY

choice "Battery select"
	prompt "Select the battery to use"
	help
	  Select the battery used on the board. If you are ensure, select the
	  smart battery option.

config PLATFORM_EC_BATTERY_SMART
	bool "Support a smart battery"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_I2C
	help
	  Many batteries support the Smart Battery Specification and therefore
	  have common registers which can be accessed to control and monitor
	  the battery.

	  See here for the spec: http://sbs-forum.org/specs/sbdat110.pdf

choice "Battery presence detection"
	prompt "Method to use to detect the battery"
	help
	  This selects the method to use to detect the presence of a battery.

	  Battery detection is important since it can be used to indicate that
	  the case is open, so security features can be disabled. It is also
	  useful to report to the user when the battery is missing, e.g. with
	  a desktop icon.

config PLATFORM_EC_BATTERY_PRESENT_CUSTOM
	bool "Call a board-provided function"
	help
	  Use this method to provide a board-provided battery_is_present()
	  function to determine whether the battery is currently present.
	  This should be implemented in the board code and can use any
	  reasonable method to detect the battery.

config PLATFORM_EC_BATTERY_PRESENT_GPIO
	bool "Check a GPIO"
	help
	  Use this method if a GPIO signals whether the battery is present. The
	  GPIO should read low if the battery is present, high if absent,

	  TODO:
	  The actual GPIO to use is not defined by this option. Perhaps this
	  needs to be placed in the devicetree.

choice "Charger select"
	prompt "Select the charger to use"
	help
	  Select the battery charger IC used on the board. Only one charger may
	  be selected.

config PLATFORM_EC_CHARGER_ISL9241
	bool "Use the ISL9241 charger"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_I2C
	help
	  Enables a driver for the ISL9241 VCD Battery Charger. This is a
	  digitally-configurable, buck-boost battery charger that can support
	  both Narrow Voltage Direct Charging (NVDC) and Hybrid Power Buck Boost
	  (HPBB/Bypass) charging and switch between the modes under firmware
	  control. It supports an input voltage range of 3.9-23.4V and output
	  of 3.9-18.3V. It provides an I2C interace for configuration.

endchoice

config PLATFORM_EC_BATTERY_FUEL_GAUGE
	bool "Board supplies battery info"
	help
	  The fuel gauge information is used to cut off the battery for shipping
	  mode and to check the charge/discharge FET status.  The battery
	  information is used to set voltage, current and temperature operating
	  limits for the battery.
