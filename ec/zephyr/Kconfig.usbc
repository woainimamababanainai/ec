config PLATFORM_EC_USBC
	bool "Enable USB Type-C functionality"
	default y
	help
	  Enable this to support various USB Type-C features chosen by the
	  options below. USB-C is widely used on modern Chromebooks and the EC's
	  role is to negotiate power contracts (for sourcing or sinking power
	  over USB). The EC is also responsible for discovering the capabilities
	  of attached USB-C partners and enabling alternate operational modes,
	  including Display Port, Thunderbolt, and USB4.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_POWER_DELIVERY
	bool "Enable support for USB Type-C Power Delivery"
	default y
	help
	  USB has always provided basic power to an attached peripheral. USB-C
	  PD is part of the USB 3.0 standard and allows a lot more functionality
	  than the basic 500mA @ 5V. It allows negotiating power delivery over
	  the USB cable to select voltages up to 20V with current up to 5A.

	  This option also enables the Type-C Port Manager (TCPM) on the EC. The
	  TCPM deals with the various state changes in the system as devices are
	  plugged and unplugged, as well as changes in power requirements from
	  those devices.

config PLATFORM_EC_CHARGE_MANAGER
	bool "Enable the charge manager"
	default y
	help
	  The EC charge manager manages charging the battery from all supported
	  power sources.  This includes dedicated charge ports (such as a
	  barrel jack connector), BC1.2 (Battery Charging 1.2) sources, and
	  USB-C sources. When multiple charge sources are connected to a
	  Chromebook simultaneously, the charge manager is responsible for
	  picking the best source.

	  Note that the charge manager assumes that at least one USB-C power
	  source is available on the hardware, so cannot be built without
	  PLATFORM_EC_USBC.

config PLATFORM_EC_CHARGER_INPUT_CURRENT
	int "Charger input current in mA"
	default 512
	help
	  This is the default input current for the board in mA.  Many boards
	  also use this as the least maximum input current during transients.

	  This value should depend on external power adapter, designed charging
	  voltage, and the maximum power of the running system. For type-C
	  chargers, this should be set to 512 mA in order to not brown-out
	  low-current USB charge ports in accordance with USB-PD r3.0 Sec. 7.3

config PLATFORM_EC_USBC_OCP
	bool
	help
	  USB-C overcurrent protection: Enable this to detect when a connected
	  USB-C partner draws too much power from the Chromebook and
	  automatically shut off power to the USB-C partner.

	  This should be enabled by drivers which can detect over-current. It
	  cannot be set otherwise, even in prj.conf

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_HOST_CMD
	bool "Enable host commands related to USB Power Delivery"
	default y
	help
	  This enables host commands which allow finding out the capabilities
	  of USB PD, checking is status and controlling how it operates. For
	  devices which support firmware update, this is provided as well,
	  with the firmware being sent from the AP.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_PORT_MAX_COUNT
	int "Maximum number of USB PD ports supported"
	default 2
	help
	  This sets the limit on the number of PD ports supported on the
	  device. This is used to set the size for tables used by devices.

	  TODO(b/176237074): Can we calculate this from the devicetree at some
	  point? Or update the sn5S330 driver to use an 8-bit flag byte for
	  source_enabled[] so that plenty of ports are supported without this
	  configuration option?

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_DUAL_ROLE
	bool "Board can act as a dual-role Power Delivery port"
	default y
	help
	  This enables support for switching between source and sink during
	  operation. This means that the port can accept power (e.g. to charge
	  up its battery), or send out power to an attached device on the same
	  port.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_DUAL_ROLE_AUTO_TOGGLE
	bool "Board can use TCPC-controlled DRP toggle"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_DUAL_ROLE
	default y
	help
	  Enable this if the USB Type-C Port Controllers (TCPC) used on the
	  board supports toggling of the power role autonomously. When this is
	  disabled, the USB power delivery task is responsible for manually
	  toggling the power role.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_DISCHARGE
	bool "Board can discharge VBUS"
	default y

	  Fast Role Swap, advertising the available power across all ports of a
	  multi-port charger, and USB4. If disabled, only USB Power Delivery
	  Rev2.0 functionality is supported.
